What is the output of the followign operations? 

## Operations

1. print (5 + 3 * 2)
2. print (5 + 3 * 2 ** 2)

3. print (8 / 3)
4. print (8 % 3)
5. print (8 // 5)

## Casting

6. print(type(4.0))
7. print(type(44))
8. print(type("22"))

9. print( int ("34"))
10. print( int (34))

11. print( float ("34"))
12. print( float (34))

13. print( int (4.4))
14. print( int ("4.4"))

## Booleans

15. print(5 < 3)
16. print(20 != 10)
17. print("abc" > "bcd")

18. print("5" < "3")
19. print("5 < 3")

## Boolean Algebra

20. print(5 < 3 or 4 < 6)
20. print(5 < 3 and 4 <= 6)
21. print(5 == 5)
22. print("apple" != "orange")

22. print(not 5 < 3)
23. print(not 5 < 3 and 10 > 4)

## If statements 

1. What is the output of the following program? 

```python
counter = 0
x = 5 
y = 10 

if x < y and x > 2 : 
	print("Block 1")
	counter = counter + 1

elif x < y and x < 2 : 
	print ("Block 2")
	counter = counter + 1

else : 
	print("Block 3")
	counter = counter + 1

print(counter)
```

2. What is the output of the following program ? 

```python
x = 10
y = 2 

if x < y and x > 2 : 
	print("Block 1")
	counter = counter + 1

elif x < y or y <= 2 : 
	print ("Block 2")
	counter = counter + 1

else : 
	print("Block 3")
	counter = counter + 1

print(counter)
```

## Loops : 

1. The primary colours are red, green and blue. Write a program that asks the user to pick one of those colours. The program should keep asking the user until they give one of the primary colors. 

2. Make a guessing game. Pick a random number and have the user guess the number. The program should exit only if the user has found the correct number. 

3. Expand on the previous program by giving the user only 3 tries, before he loses. 

4. Write a program that will ask the user for a positive integer, and will return the sum of all the numbers leading to the selected number. For example user gives 5, then the result should be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. 

5. Modify the previous program so that it sums up only the prime numbers.
